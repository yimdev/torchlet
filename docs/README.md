# Torchlet Docs Architecture

The documentation site is a static walkthrough for Torchlet's versioned inference
implementations. It is designed to work on GitHub Pages without Node, Ruby, or
third-party Python packages.

## Structure

- `docs/content/index.md`: landing page copy.
- `docs/content/versions.json`: ordered version metadata used for navigation.
- `docs/content/versions/*.md`: one teaching page per roadmap version.
- `docs/assets/site.css`: the documentation visual system.
- `docs/assets/compare.js`: browser-side version/file selector for code compare.
- `tools/build_docs.py`: static site generator.
- `.github/workflows/docs.yml`: GitHub Pages deployment workflow.

## Version Page Contract

Each version page should answer the same questions:

- What did this version introduce?
- Why was it introduced after the previous version?
- What core principle does it teach?
- Which files should readers compare?
- What tradeoff is intentionally left visible?

This repeated structure is the main teaching device. It helps readers compare
conceptual changes, not just code changes.

## Code Compare Page

The build script scans `src/torchlet/v*/**/*.py`, stores the source in
`docs/_site/data/code.js`, and creates a static compare page at
`docs/_site/compare/index.html`.

The page is intentionally simple: it aligns one file path across two selected
versions. If a file exists in only one version, the missing side says so.

## Build Locally

```bash
python3 tools/build_docs.py
```

Then open `docs/_site/index.html` in a browser.

## Deploy On GitHub Pages

The included workflow builds the docs on pushes to `main` and deploys
`docs/_site` through GitHub Pages.

In the repository settings, set Pages to use GitHub Actions as the source.

If the deployed page shows this README instead of the generated walkthrough
site, the repository is still using the branch-based Pages source. Change
Settings -> Pages -> Source to GitHub Actions, then rerun the docs workflow.
